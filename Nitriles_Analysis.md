# Introduction

Cruciferous vegetables, including broccoli, Brussels sprouts, collard
greens, and arugula, ubiquitously contain a class of compounds known as
glucosinolates (GLS) \[1\]. A single type of cruciferous vegetable will
contain a wide variety of GLS, however, they typically contain one to
three GLS in the greatest abundance \[2\]. Following damage to the cell
wall of the vegetable, the enzyme myrosinase converts GLS to bioactive
isothiocy-anates (ITC), or epithiospecifier protein can facilitate
conversion to biologically inert ni-triles (NIT) \[1,2\]. Broccoli
sprouts are known to be rich in the aliphatic GLS glucoraphanin and also
contain glucoiberin which yield the ITCs sulforaphane (SFN) and iberin
(IBN), respectively \[2\]. Epidemiological studies have shown an inverse
relationship between the incidence of lung, breast, prostate, colon, and
bladder cancer and cruciferous vegetable consumption, offering an
appealing, cost-effective, non-pharmacological approach to cancer
prevention through dietary intervention \[3–6\]. Furthermore, cell
culture and animal models have shown that aliphatic ITCs, such as SFN,
have potent anticancer properties and can suppress and prevent the
formation of cancer \[7–16\] . In contrast to these findings, human
clinical trials examining the efficacy of cruciferous vegetables
interventions on cancer prevention targets have shown high levels of
inter-individual variation in both the absorption and excretion of ITCs,
however, the source of this variation is unknown (reviewed in \[17\]).
Early work has focused on glutathione-S-transferase polymorphisms, as a
major factor modulating effects of ITC metabolism and variable effects
on cancer, but studies are inconsistent and equivocal \[18–30\]. Our own
group has shown that Nrf2 KO mice, which lack ability to induce
glutathione-S-transferases do not manifest differences in SFN metabolite
production \[31\]. As an alternative, it has been proposed that
differences in individual gut microbiomes may contribute to the observed
variation in ITC levels, potentially through the production of
biologically inert NITs from GLS by gut microbes. This is significant as
an increase in NIT production from GLS reduces the amount of ITCs
produced and thus may lower the efficacy of cruciferous vegetables
interventions.

Members of the human commensal gut microbiota have been shown to
hydrolyze GLS to both ITCs and NITs in the absence of myrosinase, such
as in cooked vegetables \[32–35\]. Preliminary studies conducted in
humans fed glucoraphanin show variations in SFN excretion coincide with
variations in gut microbiome composition \[36,37\]. In addition to this
evidence, in vitro studies demonstrated that different microbes
preferentially hy-drolyze GLS to either ITCs or NITs \[38–41\].
Additionally, consumption of cruciferous vegetables can significantly
alter the composition of the gut microbiome highlighting potential
diet-microbiome effects \[36,37,42\]. It is hypothesized that the gut
microbiome is the underlying driver of variation observed in many human
clinical trials, however, evidence in complex and dynamic systems is
lacking. More specifically, work on the role of the gut microbiome in
GLS metabolism is limited primarily to in vitro studies conducted using
GLS-isolates in monocultures of culturable organisms. These studies fail
to capture both the impacts of a whole food matrix on the microbial
metabolism of GLS, and the effects of broccoli consumption on microbiome
composition.

To further investigate the role of the gut microbiome in the production
of NIT from GLS, we utilized an ex vivo fecal incubation model using
individual human stool samples and broccoli sprouts that underwent in
vitro digestion. Despite a growing interest in how the microbiota
affects dietary chemoprevention agents, few studies have closely
examined the interaction among the gut microbiota and GLS in complex and
dynamic systems. The results of this study will assist in understanding
determinants of individual response to cruciferous vegetable metabolism
and responses to dietary interventions.

# Experimental Methods

We completed an *in vitro* digestion of cruciferous vegetables then
incubated them with human fecal stock for 24 hours under anaerobic
conditions.

For this experiment we had 3 treatment groups:

-   *fecal_stock* : The fecal slurry before incubation
-   *no_veg* : Fecal slurry incubated with media under anaerobic
    conditions (NC in the paper)
-   *broc* : 1/2 cup fresh broccoli sprouts *in vitro* digested then
    incubated with fecal slurry under anaerobic conditions

Following incubation, untargeted metabolomics was completed in positive
and negative ionization modes and 16S rRNA sequencing was competed.

We start by investigating the alpha diversity of each of our fecal
stocks.

### Alpha Diversity Metrics

``` r
adiv_stock <- ps_raw %>% 
  subset_samples(treatment == 'fecal_stock') %>%
  estimate_richness(measures = c('Observed','Shannon','Simpson')) %>%
  cbind(., data.frame(sample_data(ps_raw %>% 
                         subset_samples(treatment == 'fecal_stock')))%>%
                         dplyr::select(fecal_sample)) %>%
  remove_rownames() %>%
  column_to_rownames('fecal_sample')

gstock <- adiv_stock %>%
  rownames_to_column('fecal_sample') %>%
  pivot_longer(where(is.numeric), names_to = 'measure')

stk <- ggplot(gstock, aes(x = fecal_sample, y = value, color = fecal_sample)) +
  geom_point() +
  facet_wrap(vars(measure), scales = 'free', ncol = 3) +
  theme_cowplot() +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 90), axis.title.x = element_blank())

Fecal Stock Alpha Diversity Metrics

Let’s see if the differences in alpha diversity that we see differ by
age or biological sex.

``` r
st <- adiv_stock %>%
  rownames_to_column('fecal_sample') %>%
  left_join(.,data.frame(sample_data(ps_stock))) %>%
  select(fecal_sample, Observed, Shannon, Simpson, birth_year, biological_sex) %>%
  mutate(by_bin = ifelse(birth_year <= 1975, 1, 
                         ifelse(birth_year <= 1985, 2, 
                                ifelse(birth_year <= 1995, 3, 4)))) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c('Observed', 'Shannon', 'Simpson'), names_to = 'measure') %>%
  group_by(measure) %>%
  nest() %>%
  mutate(kw_b = map(data, function(x) kruskal.test(value ~ as.factor(by_bin), data = x) %>% broom::tidy() %>% pull('p.value'))) %>%
  mutate(kw_s = map(data, function(x) kruskal.test(value ~ biological_sex, data = x) %>% broom::tidy() %>% pull(2))) %>%
  unnest(cols = c('kw_b', 'kw_s'))

stc <- st %>%
  select(-data) %>%
  rename('Biological Sex' = kw_s, 'Age' = kw_b, 'Measure' = measure)

knitr::kable(stc, caption = 'Kruskal Wallis Test Results (p.values)')
```

| Measure  |       Age | Biological Sex |

Kruskal Wallis Test Results (p.values)

We found that there are no significant differences by age nor biological
sex. Next let’s investigate beta diversity between our stocks.

## Beta Diversity

``` r
ordBCstock <- ordinate(ps_stock, method = 'PCoA', distance = 'bray')
sbd <- plot_ordination(ps_stock, ordBCstock, color = 'fecal_sample') +
  geom_point(aes(text = paste0('Fecal Sample: ', fecal_sample, '\n',
                               'Biological Sex: ', biological_sex, '\n',
                               'Year of Bith: ', birth_year)),
             size = 3) +
  theme_cowplot() +
  colSmp +
  ggtitle('Beta Diversity of Fecal Stocks')

ggplotly(sbd, tooltip = 'text', width = 900, height = 600)

Let’s see if the patterns we see in our beta-diversity can be explained
by age or biological sex. We will do this via a PERMANOVA test.

### PERMANOVA by Age

``` r
ordBCstock <- ordinate(ps_stock, method = 'PCoA', distance = 'bray')
sbd <- plot_ordination(ps_stock, ordBCstock, justDF=T) 
distmat <- phyloseq::distance(ps_stock, method = 'bray')
#Extract the metadata
mdata <- data.frame(sample_data(ps_stock)) %>% dplyr::select(fecal_sample, treatment, biological_sex, birth_year)  %>%
  mutate(by_bin = ifelse(birth_year <= 1975, 1, 
                         ifelse(birth_year <= 1985, 2, 
                                ifelse(birth_year <= 1995, 3, 4)))) %>%
  modify_at('by_bin', as.factor)

#Set the seed for reproducibility
set.seed(120)
#Run betadisper to verify the distrubtion of our groups is equal, an underlying assumption of PERMANOVA
bdisp <- betadisper(distmat, mdata$biological_sex)
#Evaluate using a permutation test
permutest(bdisp)

Neither age (binned in 10-year intervals) nor biological sex were found
to be significant as determined by a permutation analysis of variance
(PERMANOVA) test, indicating that these factors were not driving
differences in microbial composition between fecal stocks.

# Incubation with Broccoli Sprout Digest Does Not Alter Gut Microbial Composition

Next let’s investigate the impact of anaerobic incubation and incubation
with Broc on the composition of the gut microbiome.

## Alpha Diversity

### Fecal Culture Composition

We will start by plotting the composition of our samples before and
after incubation with broccoli sprouts

### Alpha Diversity Metrics

Next let’s calculate alpha-diversity metrics and see if there are any
significant differences following incubation. We will conduct a
Kruskal-Wallis test followed by a Dunn’s Post-Hoc test.

``` r
adiv_dunn <- ps_raw %>% 
  subset_samples(treatment %in% c('fecal_stock', 'broc', 'NC')) %>%
  estimate_richness(measures = c('Observed','Shannon','Simpson')) %>%
  cbind(., data.frame(sample_data(ps_raw %>% 
                                    subset_samples(treatment %in% c('fecal_stock', 'broc', 'NC'))))) %>%
  pivot_longer(cols = c('Observed', 'Shannon', 'Simpson'), names_to = 'measure') %>%
  dplyr::select(measure, value, treatment, fecal_sample) %>%
  group_by(measure) %>%
  nest() 
walk2(.x = adiv_dunn$data, .y = list('Observed', 'Shannon', 'Simpson'), function(x, y) {
  print(y)
  dunn.test(x$value, g = x$treatment, kw = T, method = 'bh')})
```

For all measures of alpha diversity, there was a significant difference
between the pre-incubation fecal stocks and both the Broc and NC
samples. No significant differences in alpha diversity were found
between the Broc and NC treatments, however, sample T4669 did change
drastically in composition.

## Beta Diversity

Next let’s analyze the beta diversity of our samples following
incubation. We will start by calculating beta-diversity including the
pre-incubation fecal stocks.

### Beta Diversity with Fecal Stocks

``` r
ordBCall <- ordinate(ps_fbnv, method = 'PCoA', distance = 'bray')
allbd <- plot_ordination(ps_fbnv, ordBCall, color = 'treatment') +
  geom_point(aes(text = paste0('Fecal Sample: ', fecal_sample, '\n',
                               'Treatment: ', treatment)),
             size = 3) +
  theme_cowplot() +
  colTrt +
  ggtitle('Beta Diversity of All Samples')

ggplotly(allbd, tooltip = 'text', width = 900, height = 600)

We see three clusters forming: one cluster contains all the
pre-incubation samples,and two additional clusters, each of which
contained a mix of both Broc and NC samples.

### k-Means Clustering

To verify the observed clusters, k-means clustering on the PCoA with 25
random starts and using between 2 and 10 clusters was conducted.

``` r
ugh <- ordinate(ps_fbnv, method = 'PCoA', distance = 'bray') %>%
  plot_ordination(ps_fbnv, ., justDF = TRUE) 


map_df(2:10, function(x) kmeans(ugh[,1:2], x, nstart = 25) %>% extract('tot.withinss')) %>%
  cbind(2:10, .) %>%
    plot(type = 'b', xlab = 'Number of Clusters K', ylab = 'Total Within-Clusters Sum of Squares')
```

![](Nitriles_Analysis_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-9-1.png)

The elbow method on within-clusters sum of squares verified the presence
of 3 clusters within our bacterial samples. Next let’s replot our
samples with the clustering:

``` r
ughc <- kmeans(ugh[,1:2], 3, nstart = 25) %>% 
  extract('cluster') %>%
  cbind(ugh, .) %>%
  modify_at('cluster', as.factor)


c <- ggplot(ughc, aes(x = Axis.1, y = Axis.2)) + 
  stat_ellipse(aes(group = cluster, fill = cluster), geom = 'polygon', color = 'black', alpha = 0.37, show.legend = FALSE) +
  #geom_point(aes(fill = treatment), color = 'black', pch = 21, size = 4, show.legend = TRUE) +
  xlab('Axis 1 [50.1%]') +
  ylab('Axis 2 [26.5%]') +
  theme_cowplot() + 
  theme(legend.position = 'none') +
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-0.8, 0.7)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-0.8, 0.5)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c('#A50104', '#7DAF9C','#FCBA04')) +
  annotate('text', label = c('Fecal Stock Cluster', 'Mixed Cluster 1', 'Mixed Cluster 2'), 
           x = c(-0.5, 0.45, 0.1), y = c(0.3, 0.35, -0.8),
           size = 5)
  
trt <- RColorBrewer::brewer.pal(n = 3, name = 'Accent')

d <- ggplot(ughc, aes(x = Axis.1, y = Axis.2)) + 
  #stat_ellipse(aes(group = cluster, fill = cluster), geom = 'polygon', color = 'black', alpha = 0.37, show.legend = FALSE) +
  geom_point(aes(fill = treatment), color = 'black', pch = 21, size = 4, show.legend = TRUE) +
  xlab('Axis 1 [50.1%]') +
  ylab('Axis 2 [26.5%]') +
  theme_cowplot() + 
  scale_x_continuous(limits = c(-0.8, 0.7)) +
  scale_y_continuous(limits = c(-0.8, 0.5)) +
  scale_fill_manual(values = c(trt[2], trt[3], trt[1]), 
                    labels = c('Fecal Stock', 'NC', 'Broc'),
                    name = 'Treatment') +
  theme(legend.position = c(0.02,0.15))


aligned_plots <- align_plots(d, c, align = 'hv', axis = 'tbl')

ap <- ggdraw(aligned_plots[[2]]) + draw_plot(aligned_plots[[1]])

ap
```

As expected, one of these clusters was composed entirely of
pre-incubation fecal stock samples, except for a single outlying NC
sample. Consistent with PCoA findings, the other two clusters were
composed of a mix of both NC and Broc samples. Next let’s remove the
fecal stocks and replot with just Broc and NC.

### Beta Diversity Without Fecal Stocks

``` r
s1 <- ordinate(ps_bnv, method = 'PCoA', distance = 'bray') %>%
  plot_ordination(ps_bnv, ., justDF = TRUE) 

map_df(1:9, function(x) kmeans(s1[,1:2], x, nstart = 25) %>% extract('tot.withinss')) %>%
  cbind(1:9, .) %>%
    plot(type = 'b', xlab = 'Number of Clusters K', ylab = 'Total Within-Clusters Sum of Squares')
```

![](Nitriles_Analysis_files/figure-markdown_github/unnamed-chunk-11-1.png)

``` r
s1c <- kmeans(s1[,1:2], 2, nstart = 25) %>% 
  extract('cluster') %>%
  cbind(s1, .) 
s1c$cluster %<>% as.factor()


sc <- ggplot(s1c, aes(x = Axis.1, y = Axis.2)) + 
  stat_ellipse(aes(group = cluster, fill = cluster), geom = 'polygon', color = 'black', alpha = 0.37, show.legend = FALSE) +
  #geom_point(aes(fill = treatment), color = 'black', pch = 21, size = 4, show.legend = TRUE) +

  annotate('text', label = c('Mixed Cluster 1', 'Mixed Cluster 2'), 
           x = c(-0.3, 0.3), y = c(0.25, -0.6),
           size = 5)

sd <- ggplot(s1c, aes(x = Axis.1, y = Axis.2)) +

In the post-incubation PCoA, the two clusters previously observed
persisted and were once again verified by k-means clustering. Next let’s
see if the treatment we observe is due to treatment or fecal stock.

#### Treatment PERMANOVA

``` r
#First calculate the Bray-Curtis distances of the samples
distmat <- phyloseq::distance(ps_bnv, method = 'bray')
#Extract the metadata
mdata <- data.frame(sample_data(ps_bnv)) %>% dplyr::select(fecal_sample, treatment)
#Set the seed for reproducibility
set.seed(120)
#Run betadisper to verify the distrubtion of our groups is equal, an underlying assumption of PERMANOVA
bdisp <- betadisper(distmat, mdata$treatment)
#Evaluate using a permutation test
permutest(bdisp)
```

Treatment was found to be non-significant by PERMANOVA, verifying our
previous observation that the clustering observed was not driven by the
incubation of broccoli with the fecal stocks. Conversely, sample donor
was found to be significant by PERMANOVA. Cumulatively, these findings
indicate that while anaerobic incubation significantly alters the
composition of the microbiome, broccoli sprouts did not significantly
alter the mi-crobiome relative to the negative control digest.
Additionally, we identified two sub-populations within our samples,
regardless of exposure to broccoli sprouts.

# Gut Microbiome Composition Influences Nitrile Production

Using mass spectrometry, we measured the abundance of SFN-NIT and
IBN-NIT in our samples.

## Nitriles Present in Each Cluster

``` r
mdataveg <- data.frame(sample_data(ps_broc)) %>% dplyr::select(metabolomics_pos_sample, fecal_sample, treatment)
metabinterest <- read_csv('./data/metab_interest.csv') %>%
  right_join(., mdataveg, by = c('sample' = 'metabolomics_pos_sample'))

nitdata <- metabinterest %>% #Quantified IBN, IBNNIT, and SFNNIT from multiquant
  pivot_longer(where(is.numeric), names_to = 'metabolite', values_to = 'intensity') %>%
  left_join(., data.frame(sample_data(ps_broc)) %>% select(fecal_sample, group)) %>%
  filter(treatment == 'broc')

kt <- nitdata %>%
  group_by(metabolite) %>%
  nest() %>%
  mutate('p-value' = map_dbl(data, function(x) kruskal.test(intensity ~ group, data = x) %>% broom::tidy() %>% pull(p.value))) %>%
  dplyr::select(-data) %>%
  rename('Metabolite' = metabolite)
  
knitr::kable(kt, caption = 'Differences in Means NIT between Clusters')
```

| Metabolite |   p-value |
|:-----------|----------:|
| IBNNIT     | 0.0090234 |
| SFNNIT     | 0.0090234 |

Differences in Means NIT between Clusters

``` r
SEM <- function(x) sd(x)/sqrt(length(x))

nit2 <- nitdata %>%
  group_by(metabolite, group) %>%
  summarise(mean = mean(intensity), se = SEM(intensity)) %>%
  modify_at('metabolite', as.factor) %>%

We find that the relative abundance of SFN-NIT in fecal culture medium,
measured by integrating their chromatographic peak areas, was
significantly different (p = 0.009) between samples belonging to
clusters 1 and 2, with the relative intensity being 156,400 and 15,336
for each cluster, respectively. It was also significantly different (p =
0.009) for IBN-NIT, with the relative intensity being 11,844 and 4,399
for each cluster, respectively. Next we will project the abundance of
each NIT onto our beta-diversity plot and run a PERMANOVA.

## Nitriles PERMANOVA

``` r
ordBCveg <- ordinate(ps_broc, method = 'PCoA', distance = 'bray') %>%
  plot_ordination(ps_broc, ., justDF = TRUE) %>%
  left_join(., metabinterest, by = c('metabolomics_pos_sample' = 'sample')) %>%
  select(-ends_with('.y'))


vegbd <- ggplot(ordBCveg, aes(x = Axis.1, y = Axis.2, size = SFNNIT, color = IBNNIT)) +
  geom_point(aes(text = paste0('Fecal Sample: ', fecal_sample.x, '\n',
                               'Treatment: ', treatment.x, '\n',
                               'IBNNIT: ', IBNNIT, '\n',
                               'SFNNIT: ', SFNNIT))) +

PERMANOVA Results for NITs

PERMANOVA on the broccoli samples alone further corroborated that both
SFN-NIT and IBN-NIT were significantly different between the two
clusters, indicating that differing microbiome compositions yielded
differing metabolic capabilities. These results indicate that the
composition of the gut microbiome influences con-version of GLS to NITs.

# Members of Family Clostridiaceae Are Associated with Nitrile

## LEfSe Analysis

To identify which taxa discriminate between the two observed clusters
(High vs Low-NIT producers), we conducted a Linear Discriminant Analysis
Effect Size (LEfSe). LEfSe was run on the browser-based Galaxy Module.

#### 

##### LDA Results

![](postinc_lefse_res.png)

##### Cladogram

![](postinc_lefse_clad.png)

#### 

In the post-incubation samples, LEfSe identified the family
Enterobacteriaceae and the order Bacteroidales as being associated with
the low-NIT producing (cluster 2) samples. Conversely, the phylum
Firmicutes, specifically members of the Clostridia order and
Clostridiaceae family, were associated with high-NIT producing (cluster
1) individuals.

## Negative Binomial Model

To verify these results and identify individual taxa differentially
abundant between high- and low-NIT producers, a negative binomial model
was built for each taxa with abundance as the response variable and the
interaction of treatment and group as the predictors.

7 taxa were significantly different (p \< 0.05) between the observed
clusters all of which belonged to the families Enterobacteriaceae,
Enterococcaceae, Clostridiaceae, and Cori-obacteriaceae (Table 1).
Members of Enterobacteriaceae were significantly more abundant in
low-NIT individuals while taxa from Clostridiaceae and Coriobacteriaceae
were more abundant in high-NIT individuals. Members of family
Enterococcaceae were found to be more abundant in low NIT producers in
NC samples but more abundant in high NIT producers.

## Correlation Analysis

Lastly, spearman’s correlations between the abundance of each family and
the abundance of NIT across all Broc samples were performed.

Enterobacteriaceae was found to be strongly negatively correlated with
both SFN-NIT and IBN-NIT while the Clostridiaceae family was strongly
positively correlated with SFN-NIT and IBN-NIT. Enterococcaceae had a
moderately strong correlation with both SFN-NIT and IBN-NIT.

# SFN-NIT Variation Exists in Humans

Data from our fecal culture experiments and results from others suggest
that the microbiome may have an important role in how glucoraphanin is
metabolized to SFN-NIT but to date it is not clear how much SFN-NIT is
excreted following broccoli sprout con-sumption by humans. To determine
if the variations in SFN-NIT production we observed in fecal cultures
are also observed with human broccoli consumption, we analyzed urine
samples from participants fed a single dose of broccoli sprouts
containing 200 µmol of SFN equivalents (full results published in
\[16\]).

# Conclusions:

Human clinical trials utilizing broccoli sprouts, and other whole food
interventions, frequently observe high levels of inter-individual
variation between subjects coinciding with equivocal efficacy. The
source of variation is still unknown, but a growing body of evidence
points towards the gut microbiome as playing a key role in dictating the
metabolic fate of GLS from whole foods. The role of the gut microbiome
on GLS metab-olism using dynamic and complex systems is still relatively
undescribed and the human excretion of NITs, a metabolite considered to
be biologically inert of GLS, from broccoli sprouts has yet to be
measured. Utilizing urine samples from humans fed 200 µmol of
SFN-equivalents in broccoli sprouts, we detected high levels of
inter-individual variation in SFN-NIT excretion following consumption.
Using an ex vivo fecal incubation system, we determined that the gut
microbiome influences production of NITs from broccoli sprouts.
Specifically, we found that individuals with gut microbiomes enriched
with members of family Clostridiaceae had relatively high levels of
SFN-NIT and IBN-NIT while those with gut microbiomes abundant with taxa
from the family Enterobacteriaceae had a relatively low abundance of
NITs. Cumulatively, these findings point towards the gut microbiome as
playing a key role in influencing the production of NITs from broccoli
sprouts. Un-derstanding factors which drive variation in GLS metabolism
may explain why some individuals benefit more greatly from the
anti-cancer properties of cruciferous vegetables than others. For a full
discussion of our results please see our article in Nutrients.
